# Recoil Playground

This is a simple playground to experiment with [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/).

## Experiments

1. Create a test util to observe the Recoil state inside a React component (`Form`).
1. Use Immer to modify the state returned by the `setState` function from `useRecoilState` (`ImmutableForm`).
